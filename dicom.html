Within the EC <A HREF="http://www.nethotel.dk/conquest/public/cqpub.htm">Conquest</A> project, 
a full featured <A HREF="http://medical.nema.org">DICOM</A> server has
been developed based on and heavily extending the public domain <A HREF=ftp://imrad.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/pub/dicom/UCDMC>UCDMC DICOM code</A>
developed by Mark Oskin when he was at the 
<A HREF="http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu">Medical Center of the University of California at Davis</A>. 
<P>The Conquest DICOM software was written by <A HREF="marcel.html">Marcel van Herk</A> and Lambert Zijp at the <A HREF="http://www.nki.nl">Netherlands Cancer Institute</A>.We have decided to provide our extended DICOM software also to the public domain. It is now maintained by Marcel van Herk at the University of Manchester.

<P>Please check our <A HREF="https://forum.image-systems.biz/forum/index.php?board/33-conquest-users/">FORUM</A> (kindly hosted by the <A HREF="http://www.k-pacs.net">K-PACS</A> team).

Some possible applications of the Conquest DICOM software are:

<BR><IMG SRC="bullet_H.gif" ALIGN="center" ALT=" ">DICOM image viewing and slide making
<BR><IMG SRC="bullet_H.gif" ALIGN="center" ALT=" ">DICOM image selection, (limited) editing, and splitting and merging of series

<BR><IMG SRC="bullet_H.gif" ALIGN="center" ALT=" ">DICOM caching and archive merging
<BR><IMG SRC="bullet_H.gif" ALIGN="center" ALT=" ">DICOM web access for viewing and data management (scriptable)
<BR><IMG SRC="bullet_H.gif" ALIGN="center" ALT=" ">Connects to Lua IDE for all sorts of DICOM manipulation

<H2>Features of the UCDMC DICOM software are:</H2>
Complete DICOM server offering storage, verification, query and retrieve with programmable SQL database tables. This user-programmable feature allows the MicroPACS to be custom tailored to a particular Clinical/Research area.  
 
<P>The server supports a wide range of databases with ODBC (Windows) or without (Windows/Linux), including DbaseIII, MySQL, Postgres and SqLite.
<P>
<P><HR>
<H2>Some features added by the Conquest project are:</H2>

<P>Fast error free and transparent compression (>2x) of image data on disk with NKI private, JPEG or JPEG2000 compression.
<P>A database browser and slice viewer integrated in the PACS system with options for: viewing DICOM header, creating BMP files (ideal for slides), sending selected images, printing, database fix tools such as changing patient IDs, deleting and anonymizing studies and series, and splitting and merging series. Use drag and drop to load ZIP, DICOM and HL7 files.
<P>A simple query/move user interface for diagnostic purposes, to improve your knowledge of DICOM, and to grab missing data from another server.
<P>Elementary DICOM print server and client - prints to the default printer.
<P>JPEG, JPEG2000 compression and decompression (thanks to Bruce Barton) and RLE decompression supported. 
<P>Flexible configuration of JPEG and NKI private compression with optional (de)compression of incoming, dropped, transmitted and archived files.
<P>A simple DICOM Modality Worklist implementation with HL7 import with configurable translation.
<P>A CGI WEB interface with several possible viewers (also on the Linux version with does not have a GUI).
<P>The server can act as an advanced (Lua) scriptable DICOM image forwarder, processor and/or DICOM image cache.
<P>The server integrates a small web client that also acts as a viewer.
<P>The server and its webserver operation can be scripted in Lua for any type of processing and extension.
<P>A partial DICOMWeb interface is provided that works well with OHIF
